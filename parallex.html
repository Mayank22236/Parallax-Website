                I am somebody who loves adventure, new cultures, different experiences, and all the good things that one can learn outside of the comfort of our homes. I want to experience all that this beautiful earth has for us humans, document it along the way, and share it with you.

                Having followed the traveller OG for the longest time, it was always on my mind to purchase the official merchandise. To my surprise, I was gifted the ‘solo’ collection merchandise by one of my close friends on my birthday. I must say a lot of thought and effort has gone behind ideating the kickass logo. 100% marks for quality and the quirky cool design.
